    <p>Here is a restoration I did of a classic mini that was a former<br>racecar used at local race events all the way back in the 70s.<br>This was a project that I took on earlier on in the year and it<br>needed a complete revamp. So I went straight to work with<br>putting in a whole new engine, redoing the entire interior<br>and giving the car some new paint all while keeping that<br>race car look that it has always had.</p>

      <p>Here is a restoration that I had done earlier on in the year<br>when I first picked the car up I was blown away at how run<br>down  it had become due to the neglect it had faced over the<br> years. This was one of my longer projects becuase of how messed<br>up it was when I first picked it up from the previous owner.<br>After dismantling the whole of the engine, interiror and exterior and<br>giving it a complete makeover, I had managed to completley revive<br>the car to be in if not better condition than what it was when first<br>made. </p>

    <p>Here is one of my first ever restorations on a classic mini<br>so it was not an easy task restoring this as I didnt really<br>know what I was doing and was going into this<br>near enough blindfolded so I definetley did come across<br>a lot of issues during this hence why it took months to<br>eventually complete.</p>
